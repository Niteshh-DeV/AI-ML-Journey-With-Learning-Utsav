# Typical ML Workflow in Short

## 1. Problem Definition
- Identify the business problem
- Define success metrics
- Determine if ML is the right approach

## 2. Data Collection
- Gather relevant data from various sources
- Ensure data quality and quantity
- Consider data privacy and ethics

## 3. Data Preparation
- Clean and preprocess data
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates and outliers
- Feature engineering

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize data distributions
- Identify patterns and correlations
- Understand feature relationships

## 5. Feature Selection
- Select relevant features
- Remove redundant features
- Apply dimensionality reduction if needed

## 6. Model Selection
- Choose appropriate algorithms
- Consider problem type (classification, regression, etc.)
- Split data (train/validation/test)

## 7. Model Training
- Train models with training data
- Tune hyperparameters
- Use cross-validation

## 8. Model Evaluation
- Test on validation/test sets
- Evaluate using appropriate metrics
- Compare multiple models

## 9. Model Deployment
- Deploy the best model to production
- Create APIs or interfaces
- Monitor model performance

## 10. Monitoring & Maintenance
- Track model performance over time
- Retrain with new data
- Handle model drift
