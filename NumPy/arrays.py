#NumPy arrays are a powerful data structure for numerical computing in Python. 
# They provide efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets, and support a wide range of mathematical operations.

import numpy as np

# 1D array
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(array1)

# 2D array
array2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(array2)
